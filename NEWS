# Ptyxis 47.8

 * Open shell on remote host using SSH when sftp:// URIs are opened via
   Nautilus or otherwise.
 * Ensure window size is not inherited when restore-window-size is disabled.

# Ptyxis 47.7

 * Fixes to tracking podman-based containers
 * Add support for setting CursorForeground in palette files
 * Improve fullscreen mode to use the same interaction model as
   Epiphany which animate into view based on mouse pointer.
 * Add a High Contrast oriented palette based on GNOME palette.
 * Set PWD when spawning shells to improve usage within symlinks.

# Ptyxis 47.6

 * Many separate light/dark palettes have been merged so that they may
   switch between light/dark like the core palettes.
 * A new GSetting has been added to allow controlling middle-mouse-click
   behavior.
 * Use the minimum size request for the header bar to prevent --title
   from creating larger than necessary windows.
 * Fix brightness of GNOME palette on dark mode to match palette index 7.
 * Revert a workaround for reverse video cursor which caused some fg/bg
   issues in some terminal applications.
 * Ensure all palettes specify Cursor color which makes the previous
   mitigation unnecessary.
 * Allow the window to grow/shrink when dragging a tab out of the tab bar.
 * Send SIGHUP before SIGKILL upon forcing a tab to quit so that shells
   like bash may save history.
 * Mark mosh/mosh-client as "remote" processes.

# Ptyxis 47.5

 * Bump the FD soft limit to the max allowed, now that there are more
   FDs open for Vulkan shader caches.
 * Fix monitoring of podman for changes which fixes auto-discovery
   of quadlets in systemd --user services.
 * Fix disposal of tabs without a foreground process upon closing
   a Ptyxis window.
 * Robustness fixes in icon discover for tabs with containers
 * Robustness fixes in checking for active container
 * Fix scrolling within close-tabs dialog

# Ptyxis 47.4

 * Work around Podman in `--additional-flags` parsing to fix
   execution of distrobox containers.
 * Prioritize "manager":"distrobox" over "com.github.containers.toolbox"
   label because F41 images created by distrobox are, for some reason,
   setting the toolbox label id.
 * Fix raising of window when activating shell notification.
 * Override distro-theming for `vte-terminal` CSS element. This
   fixes styling on Ubuntu-based systems, but possibly others.

Thanks to everyone who filed bugs to help catch these issues.

# Ptyxis 47.3

 * Fix race condition in connecting to exited/signaled D-Bus
   signals from PtyxisIpcProcess. This fixes situations where
   quick running scripts exit before attaching to said signals,
   generally during application startup.
 * Fix --preserve-fds=0 error on distrobox.
 * Check tiled state in new-window action to start in windowed mode.
 * Fix detach-tab shortcut.
 * Translation updates

# Ptyxis 47.2

 * Fix closing window title dialog with Return/Enter
 * Fix naming of Ubuntu palette
 * Allow setting shortcuts with Fn keys on Macbooks
 * Fix some solarized palette inconsistencies
 * Translation updates

# Ptyxis 47.1

 * More clipboard fixes for initial state tracking
 * Handle shell detection when directory slash is omitted
 * Exit cleanly when ptyxis-agent exits
 * Fix VteRegex warning from the search bar
 * Fix potential leak of VteTerminal instances
 * Update gruvbox light/dark scheme
 * Translation updates

# Ptyxis 47.0

 * Implement application open file vfunc to work with Nautilus
 * Fix inintial clipboard action state
 * Fix various styling issues
 * Rename Clone of Ubuntu to Ubuntu at request of Ubuntu
 * Try to adjust window size to keep grid size the same when
   adding or removing tabs

# Ptyxis 47.rc

This is a release for GNOME 47.rc

 * Ctrl+shift+w now set as default shortcut for closing a tab, matching
   GNOME Terminal.
 * Preferences window improvements.
 * Updated GNOME Terminal palettes.
 * UI changes to improve screen reader support.
 * Make CSS provider priority less than the GTK inspector.
 * Styling improvements to match Builder and Text Editor.
 * Fix support for enabling login shells.
 * Convenience API for distros which require downstream patching for
   current directory tracking (such as Debian).
 * Fix container tracking and notifications via termprops.
 * Show opacity toggle if the setting has been changed.
 * Handle new tab creation when directory is in a GVFS FUSE path.
 * Reduce agent poll priority when ^C is pressed.
 * Overview styling and live-preview improvements to updated immediately
   when preferences changes.
 * Fix missing shortcut bindings for reset and reset-and-clear.

# Ptyxis 47.beta

This is a beta release for GNOME 47

Chances since 47.alpha

 * Ptyxis no longer requires patches to VTE when using a recent VTE
   git tag for GNOME 47.
 * Legacy libc compat was dropped for 32-bit x86 as it is unnecessary.
 * Window pallete and styling improvements to match GNOME 47 styling.
 * A new gsetting to disable padding around the terminal, at the cost
   of runtime performance.
 * Translation updates.

# Ptyxis 47.alpha

This is our first pre-release for GNOME 47 as part of 47.alpha.

Chances since 46.0

 * Many updates for GNOME HIG across dialogs and widgetry.
 * Ptyxis can run the ptyxis-agent inside the sandbox if we fail to run
   on the host. That comes with drawbacks but at least keeps the application
   working in those scenarios.
 * The build system supports some whitebox renaming allowing it to be called
   "Terminal" in some situations. Distributions shipping Ptyxis as their
   terminal may be encouraged to use that. Branding is also reduced to less
   dramatic styling.
 * Many fixes for Podman, Toolbox, and Distrobox.
 * Fallback to `sh` if we cannot locate the shell specified in /etc/passwd.
 * Improvements to the tab parking lot so that processes are properly exited.
 * Notification improvements.
 * Port Ptyxis to use the new VTE "termprops" feature. This requires a newer
   VTE than is currently released but is anticipated shortly. This reduces
   the number of patches required by Ptyxis (and eventually Fedora) to a
   single small patch for vte.sh.in.
 * New palettes styles.
 * Many new command line options and improved support for combining them.
 * Translation updates.

Thanks to everyone who filed bugs and contributed patches!
