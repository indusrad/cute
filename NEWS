# Prompt 46.alpha

Prompt is a new container oriented terminal.

It attempts to improve the experience on operating systems where users are
commonly entering or working with terminals in containers different than
the host. For example, "immutable" desktops.

Prompt takes a practical approach to preferences including support for
profiles. Users may set a default container per-profile as well as choose
to inherit the currently entered container.

Prompt does require patches on-top of VTE. These patches are similar to what
has been shipped in Fedora for a number of years. They provide some basic
container and notification abstractions on-top of VTE. In the future, we hope
to not require additional VTE patches once new functionality lands in VTE.
Packagers may find those patches in `build-aux/` which apply on top of git
master at the time of writing.

Performance and correctness of Prompt is critical upon using VTE with the
performance work I've done in the 46 GNOME cycle. In fact, the patches above
will only apply on a VTE tree which contains that work. The drawing of Prompt
will be incorrect without the upstream work in VTE.

This is an initial release, which should be considered alpha quality.
