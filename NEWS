# Ptyxis 46.6

Changes since 46.5

 * Use a lower value for CSS provider so inspector CSS changes can
   occur at a higher priority.
 * Drop libc compat mode for x86, this is unnecessary now.
 * Fix login-shell toggle in preferences
 * Show opacity control if the value is currently < 100%
 * Translation updates

# Ptyxis 46.5

Changes since 46.4

 * Ptyxis (1) man page has been added.

# Ptyxis 46.4

Changes since 46.3

 * Fix clear selection shortcut binding
 * Only allow a single palette to affect window dressing at a time,
   fixing a situation where the last palette selected takes precedence.
 * Work around misconfigured /etc/passwd in containers.

# Ptyxis 46.3

Changes since 46.2

 * stdin in child processes defaults to blocking mode as is generally
   expected of terminals.
 * Ignore tab respawn warnings when custom commands are used and they
   exited nominally.
 * Various build system and metainfo updates.
 * Translation updates.

# Ptyxis 46.2

Changes since 46.1

 * Additional troubleshooting data has been added to the about dialog
   to help users provide useful information.
 * Patches for `vte.sh` are updated to match changes I made for
   Fedora 40 which properly support PROMPT_COMMAND as a bash array.
 * Patches for a11y are updated to apply against vte-0-76 branch.
 * Ensure tabs are force-quit when timing out in the parking lot.
 * Some build system rework has occurred for Ptyxis to be compiled
   with alternate app-id and/or gschema identifiers.
 * The build system will now enforce specific linked versions of
   GLib, GTK, and libadwaita using min/max version macros.

# Ptyxis 46.1

Changes since 46.0

 * Ensure run contexts start with full environment which fixes an
   issue with running podman in some configurations
 * Fix initial tab icon state
 * Podman integration now uses PtyxisRunContext to better trampoline
   into the target container

# Ptyxis 46.0

Changes since 46.rc

 * ptyxis-agent will now fallback to running within the Flatpak
   sandbox if it cannot execute on the host. This is useful when
   you have a host that is not suitable for executing like those
   without glibc (postmarketOS) or purposefully broken linker
   loader (NixOS).

   Of course, while this allows Ptyxis to run, it will continue to
   have the shortcomings that come with PTY/ptmx coming from within
   the Flatpak namespace. Thusly, tempor your expectation of TTY API
   functionally.

 * Ptyxis will no longer attempt to start distrobox containers before
   entering them to fix a race condition in distrobox-enter.

 * Ptyxis can be "white box" renamed to Terminal using -Dgeneric=true
   when building the project. The App ID does not change but the icon
   and name within desktop files / UI is updated.

 * Updated translations: Dutch, Swedish

# Ptyxis 46.rc

Changes since 46.alpha

 * Ignore exit action if tab spuriously exited after spawning
 * Allow disabling the process leader window decoration
 * Make VS Code palette switch between light/dark theme
 * Make Horizon palette switch between light/dark theme
 * Demote rxvt style from primary palette set
 * Fallback to getent to discover user shell
 * Use whoami instead of $USER as it might not be correct
   when transitioning into a container
 * Allow disabing F10 in the shortcut preferences
 * The VTE patches have been simplified to make it easier
   to apply on top of VTE master.
 * Avoid restyling AdwDialog
 * Use AdwAboutDialog
 * Podman infrastructure containers are now ignored
 * A new italian translation
 * Various window styling improvements
 * Allow specifying default column/rows when restore-window-size
   setting is not used
 * Use --detach-keys with podman to fix ctrl+p usage
 * Initial accessibility support using vendored patches to VTE
 * Remove Ptyxis suffix from title to match gnome-terminal
 * About dialog includes a bunch of new informatio to help triage user
   issues without roundtrips to users.
 * New icon for Ptyxis branding
 * Fix where we delay reloading of podman containers to help avoid
   missing changes
 * Various improvements for the new fractional scaling support in GTK
 * Make most internal p2p D-Bus API calls asynchronous
 * Allow disabling the visual process leader colors
 * Ignore podman infrastructure containers

# Ptyxis 46.alpha

Ptyxis is a new container oriented terminal.

It attempts to improve the experience on operating systems where users are
commonly entering or working with terminals in containers different than
the host. For example, "immutable" desktops.

Ptyxis takes a practical approach to preferences including support for
profiles. Users may set a default container per-profile as well as choose
to inherit the currently entered container.

Ptyxis does require patches on-top of VTE. These patches are similar to what
has been shipped in Fedora for a number of years. They provide some basic
container and notification abstractions on-top of VTE. In the future, we hope
to not require additional VTE patches once new functionality lands in VTE.
Packagers may find those patches in `build-aux/` which apply on top of git
master at the time of writing.

Performance and correctness of Ptyxis is critical upon using VTE with the
performance work I've done in the 46 GNOME cycle. In fact, the patches above
will only apply on a VTE tree which contains that work. The drawing of Ptyxis
will be incorrect without the upstream work in VTE.

This is an initial release, which should be considered alpha quality.
